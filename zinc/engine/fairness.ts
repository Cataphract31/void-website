/**
 * Provably-fair replay.
 *
 * A round is fully determined by (config, seed, entrant order, cash-out
 * schedule): the elimination stream consumes exactly one RNG draw per live
 * player per tick plus one for the spared-survivor pick, so replaying the
 * same seed against the same exit schedule reproduces every event and every
 * balance bit-for-bit.
 *
 * The one requirement this places on live play: player decision strategies
 * must NOT draw from the round's RNG (give bots their own stream), or the
 * draw count diverges and replay breaks. The engine's `DecisionContext.rng`
 * exists for simulations, where replays are not needed.
 *
 * The commit-reveal ceremony built on top of this:
 *   1. before a round seals, publish sha256(tag : roundId : seedHex : rulesHash)
 *   2. run the round
 *   3. reveal the seed; anyone recomputes the hash and replays the round
 *
 * The rules hash is in the commitment for the same reason the seed is: a round
 * replayed under different numbers than it was played under produces different
 * results, so a ceremony that binds only the seed proves nothing about the
 * game you actually played.
