/**
 * Audio.
 *
 * Two rules came out of playtesting, and they drive everything here.
 *
 * 1. NO TONES. Bells, chimes and pitched "blings" are what made the last pass
 *    feel like a toy. Nothing in this file plays a melody or a chord you could
 *    hum, with the single exception of the jackpot, which earns it. Everything
 *    else is material: noise driven through resonant filters, plus sub. That
 *    is how real impact design works — you are meant to hear an object, not a
 *    synthesiser.
 *
 * 2. A MASS SHATTER IS MANY THINGS, NOT ONE BIG THING. Making a wipe louder
 *    sounded like a machine gun; making it deeper sounded like a bad movie
 *    trailer. Twenty plates going at once is a rockfall — a spread of small
 *    cracks, staggered by a few milliseconds each, over one shared low body.
 *    So `sfxShatter` scales in *density*, holding pitch and level roughly
 *    fixed.
 *
 * Everything runs through a convolution reverb built from a generated impulse
 * response, so sounds sit in a room instead of firing dry at the listener.
 *
 * ── Using real recorded samples instead ──────────────────────────────────
 * Synthesis is the fallback, not the ceiling. Drop audio files into
 * `apps/web/public/sfx/` and they are used automatically in place of the
 * synthesised voice, no code change:
 *
 *     tick.mp3  shatter.mp3  shatter_many.mp3  extract.mp3
 *     died.mp3  seal.mp3     join.mp3          bonanza.mp3
 *
 * (.mp3, .wav or .ogg — the loader tries each.) Anything missing keeps its
 * synthesised version, so the pack can be filled in one sound at a time.
 * Sources that are free for commercial use: freesound.org filtered to CC0,
 * or a paid pack from Soundly / A Sound Effect / Krotos.

 * three times hotter than anything synthesised here — so dropping one in made
 * it jump out of the mix. Rather than guess a trim per file, every sample is

 * The metronome — the only cue that carries continuous information.
 *
 * It fires twice a second for the whole round, so it is the one sound a player
 * hears enough times to read *without looking*. That makes it far too valuable
 * to be a constant click.
 *
 * ── Calibration ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The scale is set by where the hazard actually spends its time, not by its
 * theoretical bounds. Play a round and it opens near 7%, collapses within a
 * few ticks, then lives between roughly 0.5% and 3% for almost the entire
 * round. So that band gets the bulk of the expressive range; anything above
 * 5% is a brief opening spike and only needs to be unmistakable, not detailed.
 *
 * The mapping is logarithmic for the same reason hearing is: what registers is
 * the ratio between two values, not their difference. 1% to 2% is a doubling
 * of your chance of dying and sounds like a real change; 6% to 7% is a sixth
 * more and barely should.
 *
 *     hazard   0.35%   0.5%    1%     2%     3%     5%    7.5%

 *
 *   level      near-silent when safe, seven times louder at the top
 *   pitch      the pulse rises more than an octave
 *   timbre     a dull lowpassed pff becomes a focused resonant knock
 *   brightness the filter opens almost six-fold
 *   length     the decay stretches from a blip to a thud
 *   weight     sub-bass fades in through the upper half
 *   space      the reverb send opens, which is what reads as dread
 *
 * Past ~3% a soft sub-only ghost beat follows each tick, tightening as risk
 * climbs. See the note on it below: at a 500ms tick a full doubled beat is
 * roughly 240bpm and reads as an alarm rather than as tension.
