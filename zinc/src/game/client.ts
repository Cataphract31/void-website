/**
 * Local game driver for the prototype.
 *
 * Runs the real engine against bots on a wall clock, so the UI is developed
 * against genuine round dynamics rather than hand-waved animation. The whole
 * economy runs through the engine's own ledgers — the jackpot draw is
 * ticket-weighted across rounds via `BonanzaPool`, and the rakeback stream
 * accrues and pays through `RevShareLedger` — so the client's numbers cannot
 * drift from what the simulator certifies.
 *
 * In production this class is replaced by a websocket client consuming
 * server-authoritative round state; everything downstream of `Snapshot` stays
 * exactly as it is. NOTE the RNG seeding here is prototype-only: a live
 * deployment derives round seeds from a commit-reveal scheme on the server,
 * never from wall-clock time in the browser.
